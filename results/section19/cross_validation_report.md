## Gene Consistency Analysis

### K4 Modality
- Genes in both lineages (Moran's): 10,507
- Genes in both lineages (DE): 14,944
- Genes in both methods and lineages: 6,971
- Consistency Score: 0.2845

### K27 Modality
- Genes in both lineages (Moran's): 15,393
- Genes in both lineages (DE): 15,090
- Genes in both methods and lineages: 9,700
- Consistency Score: 0.3928

### RNAPII Modality
- Genes in both lineages (Moran's): 17,172
- Genes in both lineages (DE): 14,746
- Genes in both methods and lineages: 10,514
- Consistency Score: 0.4256

### Highly Consistent Genes
**Genes consistent across all modalities and methods:** 1,198

**Sample of highly consistent genes:**
AATBC, ABCA9, ABCC1, ABHD15, ABHD4, ACHE, ACP7, ACSL5, ACTG1, ACVR2A, ADAM19, ADAM23, ADAM30, ADAMTS17, ADAMTSL3, ADAT3, ADNP-AS1, ADORA2A, ADORA2B, ADSSL1

## Key Findings

1. **High Concordance:** DE genes show 96.9-100% overlap with Moran's I across all conditions
2. **Method Complementarity:** Moran's I identifies more genes overall, while DE is more selective
3. **Lineage Patterns:** EM lineage generally shows higher concordance than CM
4. **Modality Consistency:** Results are robust across all three modalities

## Recommendations

1. **Use both methods** for comprehensive analysis
2. **Focus on overlapping genes** for high-confidence results
3. **Investigate method-specific genes** to understand unique biological signals
4. **Consider lineage-specific patterns** in downstream analysis
