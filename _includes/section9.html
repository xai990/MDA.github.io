<h3>9.2 &nbsp;Adjust UMAP color scheme</h3>
<p>
    To enhance the visualization of trajectories across samples and time-points, 
    we will modify the UMAP color scheme. This involves selecting a color palette that effectively
    distinguishes between different samples and time-points, allowing for a clearer interpretation of the data.
    The color for the same sample should be consistent color like blue, while different timepoints should 
    be represented by different shades of the same color, such as light blue for earlier time-points and dark blue for later ones.

<p>The verbose parameter <code>verbose=TRUE</code> can be used to obtain more detailed output during the UMAP computation.</p>
<p><code>verbose=False</code></p>
